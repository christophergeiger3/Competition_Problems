These problems are from the 2018 Super Monkey Challenge Competition, hosted on HackerRank.

This competition was private to a group of about 40 students from Puerto Rico, and took place over various weeks.

All of these fantastic problems were created by Humberto Diaz, from the University of Puerto Rico. Out of respect for the creator of these problems, only a select few of the solutions I have written can be found on this repository.
